# SQL Injection Vulnerability Exploitation Lab 
This project documents the setup and execution of a hands-on lab environment designed to identify and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in a web application. The objective was to simulate a common web application attack strategy, enumerate database content through malicious input, and understand the mitigation strategies for securing web applications against SQLi.
##  Lab Overview 
A deliberately vulnerable web application was deployed in a controlled lab environment to test for SQL Injection flaws. The goal was to perform both manual and automated SQL Injection attacks, retrieve sensitive data from the backend database, and document the exploitation process.

## TOOLS

-Windows 10 VM (Attacking Machine)
-Ubuntu Server VM (Victim Machine)
- Firefox Browser
- Ubuntu Terminal/Shell
 ## Objectives 
- Deploy a web application with known SQL Injection vulnerabilities 
- Perform manual SQL Injection via web forms and URL parameters
